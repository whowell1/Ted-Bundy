This is the final project that we did for a class at Georgia Tech LMC/CM 3404 Technology of Representation. 
This final project incorporated a physical puppet and a virtul puppet. The theme of our project was Ted Bundy, 
a serial killer known for targeting women and girls. We decided to do him because Ted Bundy, was many ways a puppet, 
he manipulated woman and convinced them to follow them before he killed them.
